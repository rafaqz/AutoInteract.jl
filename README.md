# AutoInteract

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafaqz/AutoInteract.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rafaqz/AutoInteract.jl)

This module is to allow automatic generation of interactive interfaces
for any julia type than contains anything that can be controlled with buttons
and sliders.

It also facilities interactive plotting of any AbstractArray nested anywhere in
the data.


See the [Documentation](https://rafaqz.github.io/AutoInteract.jl/latest/) for more details.


Currently AutoInteract.jl supports [Interact.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Interact.jl)
and [Reactive.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl), but other signals
packages could also be supported in future.
